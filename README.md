# Customer Segmentation 
This project aims to perform Customer Personality Analysis to help businesses understand their customers better. By analyzing customer data, we can identify distinct customer segments based on their purchasing behavior, demographic information, and responses to marketing campaigns. This analysis allows businesses to tailor their products and marketing strategies to meet the specific needs and preferences of different customer segments.

The main objectives of this project are:

1.To segment customers into different groups based on their purchasing behavior and demographic characteristics.

2.To analyze the spending patterns and income levels of each customer segment.

3.To evaluate the performance of past marketing campaigns and identify the response of different customer segments.

4.To develop targeted marketing strategies to improve customer engagement and increase sales.

The project involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, clustering, and profiling of customers. The insights gained from this analysis can help businesses optimize their marketing efforts and improve customer satisfaction.
